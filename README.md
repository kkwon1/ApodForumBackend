## Introduction

NASA offers an API for a daily media upload related to astronomy called [Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)](https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Astronomy-Picture-of-the-Day-API/ez2w-t8ua).
- [NASA's official APOD Github](https://github.com/nasa/apod-api)
- [NASA's official APOD page](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html)

This Java service is a wrapper around the APOD API, which serves an APOD Forum Frontend, 
allowing users to retrieve paginated APODs, search for APODs, liking, commenting and saving posts. The forum is heavily inspired by [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/)

## Personal Note

It's been in the back of my mind to build a service around this APOD API for years. I have attempted to create a very similar service back in 2019 with GoLang.
You can view it in my public repo [APODViewerService](https://github.com/kkwon1/APODViewerService).

I wanted to completely re-write the service from scratch, because:
1. I don't really remember where I was trying to go with the previous project
2. I wanted to practice writing cleaner code with stricter interfaces and a more modular approach with packages

I've been working with Java professionally for years and felt it was the easiest to pick up and just build something out.
Once the base functionality of the service is fleshed out, I may re-write this in a different language that I want to learn
