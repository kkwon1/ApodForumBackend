# APOD Viewer (Java)

## Note 

I've been trying to build an "APOD Viewer Service" for years now, but always dropping it in the middle of it.
This project is no different, but I'm hoping to flesh it out a little bit more than I have done in the past.

## Introduction

APOD Viewer Service is a service written in Java that is designed to be a storage layer for user interaction with the NASA API.
The current NASA APOD viewer has minimal capabilities, only allowing users to navigate between images/videos.

This service will provide customizable capabilities and allow users to login, save, like, APOD images.
